Research Project: Evaluating the Performance of Big Data Processing Tools
This repository contains the code and resources for university research project titled "Evaluating the Performance of Big Data Processing Tools: A Case Study on Apache Spark and Google Dataflow." This project aims to compare the performance of Apache Spark and Google Dataflow in handling big data processing tasks, providing insights for data scientists and organizations in selecting the appropriate tool for their specific needs.

Introduction
In this research project, we investigate the performance of two prominent big data processing tools: Apache Spark and Google Dataflow. The Fourth Industrial Revolution has led to an exponential growth in data generation, presenting challenges and opportunities for organizations. To effectively process and analyze large-scale data, specialized tools have been developed, and understanding their performance characteristics is crucial for data scientists.
